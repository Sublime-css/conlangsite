        Welcome to Langforge,
        this site is a tool for sharing and creating constructed languages.
      </p>
      <p>
        Unlike natural languages like English, Finnish or Swahili that have evolved naturally over the course of time, constructed languages are purposely <i>constructed</i>. Some examples of constructed languages in fiction are Elvish from Lord of the Rings, Dothraki from Game of Thrones and Klingon from Star Trek. There is also conlangs for other purposes such as Esperanto.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can view constructed languages made by the users of this site by going to the languages page.<br>
        You can sign up or log in in the top right, above the search bar.
